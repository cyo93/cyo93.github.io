<h1>Return of the Tomb Raider</h1>
<p>Objective: To engineer the User Interface, as well as be a level designer for the game. I programmed the inventory system and special effects, as well as designed the Graveyard Level for the game.</p>
<p>Outcome: I accomplished more than the stated objectives; I improved various levels such as the graveyard, and also communicated with my team about unclear functionality in the game that may prevent it from operating properly.</p>
