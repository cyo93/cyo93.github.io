<h1>Return of the Tomb Raider</h1>
<p>Estimated Project Time: 3 months</p>
<br>
<p>Objective: To engineer the user interface, and be a level designer. I programmed the inventory system and special effects, as well as blocked out the Graveyard Level.</p>
<p>Outcome: I accomplished more than the stated objectives; I improved various levels such as the Graveyard, and also communicated with my team about unclear functionality that may prevent it from operating properly.</p>
<p>Insights: This was the first project I started learning about SCRUM reports. Being a fast learner, I learned how important they were to fostering team communication. Learning new skills in Unreal Engine quickly played a key role in my success as an engineer here.</p>
