<p><i>Return of the Tomb Raider</i> is a fan project started by students at USV. It was done to help students strengthen their skills using Unreal Engine. Phil Campbell, a former Tomb Raider level designer, helped jumpstart the project in the year before 
I participated in the project. During the fall of 2024, I worked on fixing bugs, adding new mechanics like interacting and inventory, and worked on certain levels like the Graveyard. I was also responsible for finding and fixing bugs found in the game, such as 
collision detection that doesn't work properly, guns that don't hit their targets, and items that cannot be interacted with. Furthermore, I attended all the playtesting events throughout the semester, and shared feedback, ensuring that the game gives a good 
sense of direction to the player and keeps the bugs down to a minimum.</p>
<p>Insights: This was the first project I started learning about SCRUM reports. Being a fast learner, I learned how important they were to fostering team communication. Learning new skills in Unreal Engine quickly played a key role in my success as an engineer here.
Participating in the playtests, even as someone part of the project, was also crucial to ensuring a good experience with the final product, as I can share feedback with others on how accessible and consistent the game is with others.</p>
