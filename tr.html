<h1>Return of the Tomb Raider</h1>
<p>Objective: I was an engineer for the User Interface, as well as a level designer for the game. I was in charge in programming the inventory system, special effects, as well as designing the Graveyard Level for the game.</p>
<p>Outcome: I accomplished more than was given, improving various levels like the graveyard, as well as communicated with my team about issues found in the game that may keep players from learning how the game works.</p>
