<p>Hi, My name is Chad Young and I'm currently a Senior at the University of Silicon Valley (USV). I am majoring in Game Engineering and I am fascinated with the logic that goes into video game design.</p>
<p>Since age 6, I've been intrigued by all elements of computing and software engineering. I started game development using Game Maker 7. During my childhood, I've reverse engineered games created using Game Maker, as well as experimented with the suite of tools
used in the engine. As I got older, I've been studying numerous programming languages including C++, Java, Javascript, Lua, GDScript and C#, and also learned how to use Unreal Engine, Unity and Godot. Having knowledge in numerous programming languages is 
such a valuable asset to have for a video game team since many games use different languages.</p>
<p>Later in high school, I made a Java based game inspired by pong with various maps such as a "brick-breaker" level and a level where the goals constantly shrink and grow. My teacher, Jay Huston from Stanbridge Academy, applauded me for my hard work on the project.</p>
<p>I've worked with teams and have been shown to be a very reliable teammate. Throughout my projects, team members have talked about me and how I've contributed significantly to several projects, such as Goober and Oublivious, as well as
learned more skills like GDScript, Godot, and Unity rather quickly.
My ability to learn new skills quickly is such a cornerstone in the games industry, since new technologies are released all the time, and many new games frequently use them.</p>
<p>I am the founder of CTY Technologies, which is a mobile phone repair shop. I plan for the company to be a future game studio with a team that is willing to help each other grow to become better game developers. I am also the vice president of the Game Development club 
at USV, and have contributed to a major game project, <i>Muskler</i>, writing documentation, as well as the actual game design document for the game. More details of the project will be coming soon in this portfolio!</p>
