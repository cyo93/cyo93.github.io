<h1>Oublivious</h1>
<p>Estimated Project Time: 3 months</p>
<br>
<p>Objective: I led the programming efforts for player movement, weapon rendering code and the damage system.</p>
<p>Outcome: I accomplished the given objectives, and in addition, I worked on enhancing the visual presentation of the game, by improving the realism of the images.</p>
<p>Insights: I found that attention to detail, learning how to use GDScript, and teamwork were key in developing this game. I also worked on the game's level with the other level designers, making it look better and palatable to players who want to play the game.
Sometimes, features that are programmed in the game have to be cut later on, and the bow and arrow I programmed had to be one of these features.</p>
