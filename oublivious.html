<p>In my time at USV, I had to take several game studio classes in order to learn the general pipeline for game development. This project was created in order to understand better the fundamentals of prototyping video games, from the ideas to the storefront.
My team collaborated to create the story of the game, as well as the general gameplay for the player. We chose to use Playstation styled graphics for the game's art style after some brainstorming. 
I became the lead engineer for the project, programming character movement, combat, and the damage system while my other team members were working on writing and the
artwork for the game. Although the game was still in a rough state (We only had three months), it was praised by others for the unique art style, which I contributed to for the game's level.</p>
<br>
<h2>Insights</h2>
<p>I found that attention to detail, learning how to use GDScript, and teamwork were key in developing this game. I also worked on the game's level with the other level designers, making it look better and palatable to players who want to play the game.
Sometimes, features that are programmed in the game have to be cut later on, and the bow and arrow I programmed had to be one of these features.</p>
