<h1>Project Bookcraft</h1>
<p>Objective: Help a client, Pixel Poxet, work on their next game, which is currently called Project Bookcraft.</p>
<p>Outcome: With excellent communication from the game team, I was able to improve performance of the game, as well as provide a seamless experience with the User Interface, making it easy to use for players that want to use either a keyboard or a controller.</p>
<p>What's more, I made it easy for any system I create for any writer/designer to use, such as the dialogue system.</p>
