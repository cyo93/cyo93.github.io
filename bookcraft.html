<h1>Project Bookcraft</h1>
<p>Objective: Help a client, Pixel Poxet, work on their next game, which is currently called Project Bookcraft.</p>
<p>Outcome: Actively communicated with the game team throughout the agile development process. I improved performance of the game through the use of profiling, and I also enhanced the user experience by streamlining the user interface.</p>
<p>What's more, I made the implemented features easy for any writer/designer to use, such as the dialogue system.</p>
