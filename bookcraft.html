<h1>Project Bookcraft</h1>
<p>Estimated Project Time: 3 months</p>
<br>
<p>Objective: To assist a client, Pixel Poxet, to engineer their next game, currently called Project Bookcraft.</p>
<p>Outcome: Actively communicated with the game team throughout the Agile development process. I improved game performance through the use of profiling, and I also enhanced the user experience by streamlining the user interface. Attended two different QA Testing sessions to ensure good game quality.</p>
<p>What's more, I made implementing the use of certain features easy for any writer/designer, such as the dialogue system. Being a QA tester for the builds of the game was fun, and also critical as feedback was important to improving the gameplay experience for
the final product. QA Testing is not just playing the game like a gamer would, but also trying to test for glitches by repeating actions over again and trying to trigger bugs by, for example, jumping on a box 100 times or running against walls to see if the player falls off the map.</p>
