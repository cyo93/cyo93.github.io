<h1>Project Bookcraft</h1>
<p>Objective: Help a client, Pixel Poxet, work on their next game, which is currently called Project Bookcraft.</p>
<p>Outcome: Actively communicating with the game team through active communicative and the application of agile development principles, I was able to improve performance of the game, as well as provide a seamless experience with the User Interface, making it easy to use for players that want to use either a keyboard or a controller.</p>
<p>What's more, I made the implemented features I created easy for any writer/designer to use, such as the dialogue system.</p>
