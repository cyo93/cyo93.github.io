<h1>Project Bookcraft</h1>
<p>Early 2025</p>
<p>Estimated Project Time: 3 months</p>
<br>
<img src="bookcraft.png"></img>
<p>For one of the Senior Game Studio classes at USV, I was tasked with assisting an actual indie game studio, known as Pixel Poxet to work on their next big project <i>Project Bookcraft</i>. The team responsible had to write character, level, and game concepts for the client, 
and the engineers would then implement these concepts into the product. I was assigned to work on the core dialogue system for the game, which was critical since the game is about storytelling. I also had to document whatever I create, so it would be easier for those
not in the engineering field to use tools to help write dialogue for the game. Furthermore, I used Unreal Engine 5's debugging tools to discover and remedy performance issues found in the game as well.
Pixel Poxet needed many playtesters, so I attended the playtest sessions and played in the editor to make sure that everything works like it should.</p>

<h2>Insights</h2>
<p>Implementing certain features needs to be easy for anyone who is outside the engineering team, such as the writers and the artists, which is why I documented everything I implemented through Unreal's Blueprint System. 
Being a QA tester for the builds of the game was fun, and critical as feedback was important to improving the gameplay experience for the final product. QA Testing is not just playing the game like a gamer would, 
but also trying to test for glitches by repeating actions over again and trying to trigger bugs by, for example, jumping on a box 100 times or running against walls to see if the player falls off the map.</p>
