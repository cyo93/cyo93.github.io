<h1>ISOBreaker</h1>
<p>Estimated Project Time: 3 months</p>
<br>
<p>Objective: Learn about various filesystem formats found in ISO files and create a program that parses and reads such formats.</p>
<p>Outcome: I was able to document not only one, but three different file-systems found in ISO files, as well as document each in an article found on this website and extract files from each type of ISO.</p>
<br>
<p>Insights: I found that learning new skills fast is very important as a game engineer, and learning QT for the project was quite fun and challenging. Many game developers are required to learn new technologies and read about them as they are being released.
It's also good to learn skills other than creating video games, as they can help others learn how to create custom file formats for game engines, as well as open up opportunities for careers outside of game development, such as forensics in this case.</p><p> Learning how to
find a stopping point for projects was also crucial as well, as it was easy to fall into the trap of continuing to work on a program too much in order to try and make it "perfect". I later released the program as a closed beta to Rob Curl, who is the special advisor
at the Museum of Art and Digital Entertainment, a video game museum in Oakland I volunteer at. I also plan to release the beta to other volunteers in the tech team at the MADE as well. 
For this reason, I consider this program to be part of my volunteer work at the MADE, along with the technical repair work I've previously done at the museum.</p>
