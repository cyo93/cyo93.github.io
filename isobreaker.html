<p>As a kid, I've always been fascinated with how computers store and retrieve data. I wanted to understand the logic behind data storage and how files are organized and accessed quickly. What I found during my research was that many file-systems use tree 
structures to manage and store data, which seems difficult to master at first, but gets easier to understand when studying them for quite a while. I later began to study file-systems such as ISO-9660 and the Xbox disc file-system to find out more about the intricacies 
of each file tree. Once I made a program that parses such file-systems, I published an article on the portfolio detailing how each file system I studied works. I feel proud of the progress I made with understanding data structures like trees and binary search structures 
and hope to expand this project to hard disk file-systems like NTFS and FAT in the future. I'm currently working on how to get my program to read compressed ISO's like CHD and RVZ 
and plan to release this program by the end of 2025. However, I'm quite busy with other projects in Game Dev Club at USV, and it may be delayed until 2026. In the meantime, there is a closed beta that I distributed 
to some volunteers at a video game museum known as The Museum of Art and Digital Entertainment.</p>
<br>
<p>Insights: I found that learning new skills fast is very important as a game engineer, and learning QT for the project was quite fun and challenging. Many game developers are required to learn new technologies and read about them as they are being released.
It's also good to learn skills other than creating video games, as they can help others learn how to create custom file formats for game engines, as well as open up opportunities for careers outside of game development, such as forensics in this case.</p><p> Learning how to
find a stopping point for projects was also crucial as well, as it was easy to fall into the trap of continuing to work on a program too much in order to try and make it "perfect". I later released the program as a closed beta to Rob Curl, who is the special advisor
at the Museum of Art and Digital Entertainment, a video game museum in Oakland I volunteer at. I also plan to release the beta to other volunteers in the tech team at the MADE as well. 
For this reason, I consider this program to be part of my volunteer work at the MADE, along with the technical repair work I've previously done at the museum. Compressed ISO's are planned to be supported in the future when the program is released.</p>
