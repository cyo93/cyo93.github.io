<h1>ISOBreaker</h1>
<p>Estimated Project Time: 3 months</p>
<br>
<p>Objective: Learn about various filesystem formats found in ISO files and create a program that parses and reads such formats.</p>
<p>Outcome: I was able to document not only one, but three different file-systems found in ISO files, as well as document each in an article found on this website and extract files from each type of ISO.</p>
<br>
<p>Insights: I found that learning new skills fast is very important as a game engineer, and learning QT for the project was quite fun and challenging. Many game developers are required to learn new technologies and read about them as they are being released.</p>
<br>
<p>Skills Learned:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>QT</p></li>
<li><p>C++</p></li>
<li><p>Filesystems</p></li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Skills Applied:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>C++</p></li>
<li><p>Time Management</p></li>
<li><p>Attention to Detail</p></li>
</ul>
