<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hi, My name is Chad Young and I'm currently a Senior at the University of Silicon Valley (USV). I am majoring in Game Engineering and I am fascinated with the logic that goes into video game design.</p>
<p>Since age 6, I've been fascinated by all elements of computing and software engineering. I started game development using Game Maker 7.</p>
<p>I am currently working on a number of projects and game design documents, including several game concepts that leverage Unreal Engine and Godot.</p> 
<p>I am also a member of the Game Development club at USV.</p>
