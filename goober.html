<p>In a C# programming class in my university, everyone had to work in teams in a Ludum-Dare style contest to create a game within a short time-frame and whoever won was given a free Steam gift card. We all had to use Unity, and
I was assigned with Kyle Dean and Nicholas Nguyen to create a project, and my objective during the semester was to find furniture online, and create hazards for the player to avoid. Our game was the winner of the contest out of all the games presented
in the class.</p>
<br>
<p>Insights: Working as a team requires substantial dedication and planning, which we accomplished during brainstorming and development of the game. Having knowledge of Unity and C#, as well as the ability to learn quickly and collaboratively, were also key elements to 
the completion of this game.</p>
