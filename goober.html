<h1>GAM231 Final Project</h1>
<p>Estimated Project Time: 2 months</p>
<br>
<p>Objective: To design various objects for the first level of the game.</p>
<p>Outcome: I not only worked on designing the various stage hazards and platforms, but I also made the overall game feel realistic. My game was the winner in the game making contest in my C# class in USV.</p>
<br>
<p>Insights: Working as a team requires a lot of dedication and planning, which we were doing during brainstorming and development of the game. Having knowledge in Unity and the willingness to learn quickly were also key traits to finishing this project.</p>
