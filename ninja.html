<h1>Fruit Ninja</h1>
<p>Late 2023</p>

<h2>(Note: This project is not affiliated with Halfbrick Studios)</h2>
<p>Estimated Project Time: 1 month</p>
<br>
<p>As part of a C# programming assignment at USV, I had to re-create a popular mobile game. Fruit Ninja was the choice for me, as I was familiar with this game, and figured it would be quite fun to make. 
During the project, I worked on everything, from the slicing to the strike system, and the bombs that players must avoid. Even for a one-person job, many found the work to be quite impressive for a one-person development team. Testing the project was also very important,
so I played the game in the editor and tested it further by packaging the project and seeing how users would see the game.</p>
<br>
<h2>Insights</h2>
<p>The more projects I create using a game engine, the more knowledge I have to start up another project. I did this project alone and it turned out quite well because of my prior knowledge with C# and Unity in the past. Sometimes, 
projects can behave differently when built for shipping and that functionality should be tested before a game is shipped out on storefronts or distributed to others online.</p>
