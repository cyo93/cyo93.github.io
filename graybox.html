<p>In a level design class at USV, we had to prototype a game from scratch and create it using a team. During some brainstorming, we came up with an idea of a Mario-Maker esque game, but where the player is helping the character reach the goal by placing objects in
the level rather than controlling the player directly. During the brainstorming process, we went with a story that critiques the work culture in the United States, hence the name of the game <i>Graybox</i>. I was later assigned to work on three level concepts,
save system, and physics for the game as well. During the development of the game, my team and the class noted that I, along with the others, were committed to doing hard work, both on creating levels and engineering various aspects of the game itself.</p>
<br>
<p>Insights: Having prior knowledge of C# was very important in my role as an engineer, as well as being perserverant and time conscious. "Wearing many hats" is a critical skill in the gaming industry, and people are known to try different roles other than their main role.</p>
