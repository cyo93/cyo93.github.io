<h1>GrayBox</h1>
<p>Estimated Project Time: 3 months</p>
<br>
<p>Objective: To program character physics, as well as power-ups and level selection.</p>
<p>Outcome: I not only played a significant role in the engineering behind the game, but I also worked on several levels that are found in the final product.</p>
<br>
<p>Insights: Having prior knowledge of C# was very important in my role as an engineer, as well as being perserverant and time conscious. "Wearing many hats" is a critical skill in the gaming industry, and people are known to try different roles other than their main role.</p>
